We don't think enough ideas are heard. 

There are lots of reasons for this and we think we can help

Lack of ability - I don't know how to present my idea
Lack of opportunity - I don't know who to tell about my idea
Lack of belief - I don't think anyone will care about my idea






Our vision is to help the world find its voice. A human voice, spoken in public, with confidence and with purpose. 

You don't just become a great public speaker over night or deliver a word class TED talk by accident. It takes knowledge, practice and feedback to master the skill. 

If you bring the ideas we'll give you the knowledge, a stage to practice and host of listeners eager to provide you with the feedback you will need to improve.
