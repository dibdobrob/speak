We care about feedback because without it we cannot improve, we cannot grow and we cannot launch our ideas into the big bad world.

We'll give it and it will always be structured into the following categories.

1. Authenticity - Your belief in your idea
2. Story telling - What you said
3. Delivery - &nbsp;How you said it
4. Transformation - Our belief in your idea

**What you do with it is up to you!**
