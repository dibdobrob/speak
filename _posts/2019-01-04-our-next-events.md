The spring 'seedling' series will be taking place from early March in Manchester.&nbsp;<br><br>As the name might suggest, the 'seedling' series will be focussed on giving the previously unheard a stage upon which they can speak, learn and grow.&nbsp;<br><br>If you are interested in being a seedling, listening to what our new speakers have to say or providing support and guidance to our seedlings then please check out out '[How to page](/https:/dibdobrob.github.io/speak/event-schedule/)' for more information.<br><br>A full schedule of events will be published on meetup.com by the end of Jan 2019.
