     The spring 'seedling' series will be taking place from early March in Manchester.
     
     </br></br>As the name might suggest, the 'seedling' series will be focussed on giving the previously unheard a stage upon which they can speak, learn and grow. 

     </br></br>If you are interested in being a seedling, listening to what our new speakers have to say or providing support and guidance to our seedlings then please get intouch.
